Check Slack and Waffle on a daily basis!

Slack:
https://softwareksu.slack.com/

Waffle:

There will be a thread posted in Slack on a random day of the week. If you respond to it within 24 hours, you get a point. What are points good for, you ask? The more points you get, the more points you'll have! The Slack desktop application and the phone app are good to have, so download them.

Tasks are going to be delegated through Waffle. Some will have due dates (the correct form is "[Due: MM/DD]").

That's pretty much everything you need to know for the time. If you have a question, Slack is a great place to go! The more movement, the better.
